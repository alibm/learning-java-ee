Hello Enterprise Application Project
=================
This is the simple Enterprise Application that contains EJB module and Application Client module, using Eclipse and Weblogic as environment.

Since there's little resources about using WebLogic command tool to run Java EE Application Client, I searched the internet and looked up the official documents and this is what I learnt. The tutorial is writting in Chinese, but you can fetch the source code into eclipse and view it, they are simple, I'm sure you can run it.

My blog: http://www.csdn.net/fengqiuzhihua, it is writen in Chiense, and I will be trying to translate them into English in the project readme file as best as I can.
